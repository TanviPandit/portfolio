                    <h4><br>Hello, I am Tanvi Pandit. I am currently a freshman at Dublin High School. My personal career goal is to become a 
                    computer engineer. A computer engineer develops and improves software 
                    programs and hardware that makes the computers run. I plan to achieve 
                    this career goal of mine by finding internships and applying for them. 
                    Taking this step could help in building up my resume. Internships on my 
                    resume would help in getting me hired since work experience is often 
                    required for jobs in the field of computer science. In order to pursue 
                    this career, I will go to college and get a bachelor's degree in 
                    Computer Science as well. I am currently putting my plan into action by taking 
                    Computer Science electives in which I learn coding languages and 
                    practice them by creating projects. My career choice is to become a 
                    computer engineer because of my passion for technology.</br>

                    <br>In order to be successful in the field of computer science, an employee 
                    needs to be skilled in coding languages and be able to work with others. 
                    I demonstrate the characteristic of cooperation when I work well with 
                    others to achieve a common goal. While working with others is beneficial, 
                    knowing how to work independently is another important trait, which I 
                    have used to get work done quickly and stay on task.  In middle school, 
                    I worked as a cashier in the cafeteria. Through this experience, I 
                    developed the skills of time management and organization. I use this to 
                    identify problems, develop solutions, and execute multiple tasks at once. 
                    I have also dedicated my time to the clubs, Technovation, and DHS 
                    (Dublin High School) Friends of the SPCA (Society for the Prevention of 
                    Cruelty to Animals). From these experiences, I learned to be open-minded 
                    and now know how to support causes I believe in. One skill I am proud of 
                    is calmness. This will help in the field of computer science because if 
                    a program will not work, I will take the time to look through all of the 
                    code and find the issue. I will not stress or give up. </br>

                    <br>Ultimately, the field of computer science is appealing because of my 
                    interest in technology. Using my characteristics of cooperation and 
                    calmness along with my skills of time management and organization, I 
                    hope to earn a position as a computer engineer in the field of computer science. </br>
