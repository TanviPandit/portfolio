                    <h4><br>This project was created for the purpose of fun and entertainment.
                    The project started on August 29, 2017 and was finished on September 8, 2017.
                    My partner for this project was Avi Patel. The creative 
                    process we used was to have two versions of the game. We 
                    experimented with code on one of the versions. Later on, we took 
                    the successful code and used it for the final product. This 
                    process worked out really well for us. We would both try out 
                    ideas on our own and then come to class and discuss which one 
                    would make it onto the final version. Through this project I 
                    learned a basic understanding of if then and true or false statements.</br>
                    
                    <br>In the beginning of the project, we had some struggle figuring 
                    out which type of game or story we should do. We got over this 
                    by talking about the pros and cons of each one. We listened to 
                    each other to see what ideas each of us had and if we would 
                    implement them or not. Since some ideas were opposing, we used 
                    our creative process on them. Later on, the idea that one of 
                    us was opposing, would end up on the final product because it 
                    worked out in the experimental version. We also started discussing 
                    the ideas more towards the end where we could not experiment that 
                    much since we had to work on the final product. We listened to 
                    each other and gave each other advice on why or why not we could 
                    implement it or how if we could change it just a little bit it 
                    would work. It was almost like giving each other a claim, evidence, 
                    and reasoning speech. Overall, it was a fun experience and because 
                    we talked everything over, we ended up with a great final product.</br>
